#aSauna

aSauna is a loose clone of Asana, a project management app. Users can organize themselves via projects and tasks. Every project has details, tasks. Users can modify projects, tasks, their profile, and comments they make

This project has been a indication to my ability to be a skilled and diciplined developer. Only two full-CRUD features were required to pass given a two-week sprint, and I was able to complete that withing the first few days. In around half the time given I was able to construct four full-CRUD features. I spent a large time afterwards on styling to make the app feel as lived in as possible.
